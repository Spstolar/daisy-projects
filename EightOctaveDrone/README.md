# Eight-Octave Drone

This is a simple patch for the Field. The keys will determine the root note, and a sine wave for that root as well its 7 octaves above will play. The knobs will determine the volume for each octave's sine wave allowing some simply play with harmonics. 

## TODO

* Normalize the final output. (probably scaling the final signal based on the sum of the knob values)
* Show the knob values on the screen.
* Use the CV inputs for filtering. 
* Use the switches to change the knob purposes from component volumes to various effects.
